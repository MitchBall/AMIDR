AMID data can be fit to the AMIDR model, but this is not recommended as this will amplify systematic error in AMID's multi-rate protocol. AMIDR data can also be fit to AMID's model but this is not recommended as this allows $R$ to be falsely measured as $D_c$.\n",

    "Ideally, the specific capacities of the cell being tested could be used to calculate ion saturation. However, it is very difficult to accurately measure the amount of active mass for electrodes with very low mass loadings. This means the specific capacity of each fit is innaccurate producing error in ion saturation and $D_t^*$. To compensate for this, the cell's specific capacities can be linearly adjusted to match its voltages which are accurately measured. This is done with 2 datapoints from a regular mass loading half cell with accurately measured specific capacity and voltage. It's recommended that these two datapoints are far apart but still within the voltage range of the AMIDR test and are determined as the average of a charge datapoint and a discharge datapoint that are not located on a plateau or cliff edge. <br> *e.g., tracer_inputs = \\[303, 275, 3.7, 66, 4.1, 171\\]* <br> *Default is \\[\\]*\n",

This value is normalized by the surface area of the active material so that it is inherent to the material and not dependent on the mass loading. If it is believed that the primary source of the resistance is the interface resistance, this value will be calculated accurately. Regardless, it is expressed as the \"maximum\" $ρ_{c}$ because a portion of it, no matter how small, will be from other sources. Error in the active mass and density values will contribute a proportional error in the calculated interface contact resistivity. However, because interface contact resistivity often changes drastically on a logarithmic scale, this error can be mostly ignored. <br> *Default is 4.9*\n",
